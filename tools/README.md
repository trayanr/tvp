# Repository tools

All six apps are copied by `tools/lib/owned-cli.nix`, a direct derivation run by
TVP Bash with TVP coreutils. It installs explicit Bash shebangs and checks each
script with `bash -n` and ShellCheck (a borrowed build-time validator). It uses
no stdenv setup, wrapper hooks or compiler. Text manifests use `builtins.toFile`.

The four shell commands retain `errexit`, `nounset` and `pipefail`, and prepend
their declared tools in order to the caller's PATH. The Python entrypoints exec
TVP Python, forward every argument, and set `TVP_DEPENDENCIES_SYSTEM` or
`TVP_TEST_SYSTEM` from the selected native platform. They leave PATH alone.
The helper supports these scripts only; it is not a general packaging API.

Explicit runtime utilities and interpreters are TVP packages except jq, which
has no TVP recipe. Commands that query Nix use the caller's host Nix API.
Inherited bootstrap closures and the test runner's external strace boundary
remain separate from this packaging change. Ruby's extension tests retain an
owned GCC 13 consumer compiler as a control against GCC 16-built Ruby.

`tvp-test verify --run /absolute/frozen/run --output report.json` reads one
terminal full attempt without running status, evaluating source, building or
writing run caches. It checks reporting, derivation outputs and the current
aggregate/suite/test links, including validity of secondary outputs. Reports use
`tvp.validation-report/v1`; input hashes reference large inventories. Output files
are immutable: a conflicting report or an input alias is refused.

For exported evidence use `--plan plan.json --state status.json --adapter ci-status`
(the raw adapter is the default). Exported status may have an observation time
after completion and must include source, exclusions,
run and suite counts; local worker evidence is explicitly unavailable. Store links
are always observed on the executing host, never inferred from exported link rows.
Use `--expect-revision`, `--expect-source` and `--expect-system` for external
bindings. `--reference-plan` compares the entire reviewed plan; `--revision-only`
permits only its revision field to differ for squash replay.

`--graph-before` and `--graph-after` use the existing graph comparison semantics
and are informational. Optional `--invariants` JSON has schema `1` and exact
`graphEntries`, `planJobs`, `skipped` and/or `graphDelta` expectations. It supplies
policy data without changing CI policy. `--log` and `--prepare-log` attach execution
observations; missing logs mean unknown. Cached outputs and a successful report
establish neither fresh execution, source approval nor ABI compatibility.
